# 🧠 Multi-Turn Intent Classification from Chat Conversations

This project implements a **multi-turn intent classification system** to identify user intent from chat-style conversations (e.g., WhatsApp threads). Developed as a machine learning assignment, it explores both **fine-tuned classification** and **zero-shot learning** approaches for classifying user intents based on multi-turn dialogues.
